\title{Plot mass data from dual inlet files}
\usage{
iso_plot_dual_inlet_data(iso_files, data = c(), panel_by = "data",
  color_by = "file", linetype_by = "none", shape_by = "SA|STD")
}
\arguments{
\item{iso_files}{collection of iso_file objects}

\item{data}{which masses and ratios to plot (e.g. c("44", "45", "45/44")), if omitted, all available masses and ratios are plotted. Note that ratios should be calculated using \code{\link{iso_calculate_ratios}} prior to plotting.}

\item{panel_by}{whether to panel data by anything, options are "none" (overlay all), "data" (by mass/ratio data), "file" (panel by files), "SA|STD" (panel by sample|standard). The default is "data"}

\item{color_by}{whether to color data by anything, options are the same as for \code{panel_by} but the default is "file"}

\item{linetype_by}{whether to differentiate data by linetype, options are the same as for \code{panel_by} but the default is "none". Note that a limited number of linetype_by (6) is defined by default and the plot will fail if a higher number is required unless specified using \code{\link[ggplot2]{scale_linetype}}}

\item{shape_by}{whether to shape data points by anything, options are the same as for panel_by but the default is "SA|STD" (sample|standard)}

\description{
Plot mass data from dual inlet files
}
\note{
normalization is not useful for dual inlet data, except potentially between standard and sample - however, for this it is more meaningful to simply plot the relevant ratios together
